What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 When you initialize a repository, it begins as an empty repository.  Running git
 status will reveal any files you have within that repository that has not been
 committed.  These files are "untracked files", meaning they have not been comitted.
 If you do not initialize a repository, you will not be able to commit any of its
 files to Github.
