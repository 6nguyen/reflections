What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 When you initialize a repository, it begins as an empty repository.  Running git
 status will reveal any files you have within that repository that has not been
 committed.  These files are "untracked files", meaning they have not been comitted.
 If you do not initialize a repository, you will not be able to commit any of its
 files to Github.





How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

 The staging area is different from the working directory and repository in that it is
 an intermediate step between the two.  In order to add files into a repository, you
 must first take it from the working directory and add it into the staging area.  Once
 the file is added into the staging area, it can then be committed.  The committed file
 now exists in the repository.
 This allows users to view all the files they would like to add into a single commit and
 helps clarify the logical change and purpose of the commit.
